### Literature-based Random Generator

This is a script to take an existing document - say, a novel - extract
interesting terms and use them to generate characters, locations, events, etc.
using the lexicon of the original document. There's still a long way to go, but
at least the results so far are amusing. 

One neat trick already in place is that you can use multiple files as input,
allowing interesting combinations (examples forthcoming).
